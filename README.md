# Vector Map of Lithuania 🗺️

Welcome to the exciting world of mapping Lithuania! Dive into the beauty and functionality of our free and open-source
map project inspired by [Proton Maps](https://protomaps.com/).

## What's Inside?

This project offers an early-stage experiment in creating a free and open source vector map for Lithuania.

## Getting Started 🚀

To embark on your mapping journey, follow these simple steps:

- **Install Java 21+:** Ensure Java is installed on your system to power up the mapping engine.

## Instructions 📝

### Generating GRPK Basemap

Fire up the map-making magic by executing `./gradlew run` to generate the basemap in pmtiles format. The generated
pmtiles will appear in `grpk/data/output/grpk.pmtiles`.

Please note that this process may take some time as the GRPK data source will
be downloaded if it doesn't exist already.
